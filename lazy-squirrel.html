faqs:
  - question: How to play?
    answer: "In order to solve a level, <b>continuous zones</b> need to be created for <b>each 
      type of nut</b>. A zone is considered continuous if each nut(nut’s room) has at 
      least one common edge with another nut of the same type.<br/>
      Two nuts can be swapped or a whole row/column can be reversed. If there is <b>no wall</b>
      in the direction a nut is moved, then it will just <b>exchange positions</b> with the nut 
      from the next room. In case there is <b>a wall, or partial blocker</b>(vegetation textured room), 
      in the direction a nut is moved, nut’s <b>positions will be reversed</b> for the whole row/column. 
      A row/column that contains partial blocker(s) will allow only partial nuts reversal: 
      nuts from the opposite rooms of partial blockers won’t be moved.<br/>
      A row/column that contains <b>total blocker</b> (stone textured rooms) will <b>not allow 
      row/column nuts reversal</b> at all."
  - question: What are golden acorns and how to earn them?
    answer: "Golden acorns are Lazy Squirrel’s <b>currency</b>.<br/>
      Get them by <b>solving levels or requesting gift</b> golden acorns in the main screen.<br/>
      Use them to buy lives or bombs."
  - question: What is a bomb and where to use it?
    answer: "A booster that can be used to destroy a wall during gameplay: drag a bomb 
      from the button located at the top of the game screen, align the cursor’s pointer 
      with the wall to destroy(bomb cursor should become opaque) and drop the bomb."
  - question: A few words about lives?
    answer: "There can be a <b>maximum of five lives</b>.<br/>
      A lost level causes the loss of a life, but after <b>every twenty minutes</b> 
      the number of lives is <b>increased by one</b>. To <b>get a life faster</b>, 
      use <b>golden acorns</b>, <b>share</b> Lazy Squirrel Facebook 
      page on your wall or <b>get a gift</b> 
      life (in main menu screen)."   
  - question: How can I share my highscores?
    answer: "Use your G+ account to share a highscore or to see the leaderboard for 
      the selected season(see buttons located in the bottom-right side of the levels 
      panel in main menu screen).<br/>
      Subsequent Google Play Services update and game restart might be needed."

      <p>Lazy Squirrel invites you to <strong>test your</strong> nuts collecting <strong>skills</strong>. 
      In an environment where the Squirrel is too Lazy to gather dried fruits, you step in 
      and make sure it stays full. Deal with <strong>nuts’ rows reversal</strong>, <strong>nuts’ swap</strong> 
      and blockers to form <strong>continuous zones</strong> for each type of nut thus reaching your goal.</p>
